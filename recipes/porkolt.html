        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 slices bacon, diced</li>
            <li>2 large onions, diced</li>
            <li>¼ cup Hungarian paprika</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>5 pounds boneless pork chops, trimmed</li>
            <li>1 large yellow bell pepper, seeded and diced</li>
            <li>2 (14 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, with liquid</li>
            <li>⅔ cup beef broth</li>
            <li>2 cups reduced-fat sour cream</li>
            <li>2 (6 ounce) packages wide egg noodles</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook
         over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about
         10 minutes. Drain, and reserve the drippings. Add
         the onions to the bacon and cook together until the 
         onion is translucent. Remove skillet from heat and 
         stir the paprika, garlic powder, and pepper into the 
         bacon mixture. Transfer the mixture into a large 
         stockpot.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Heat a small amount of the reserved bacon drippings
         in the skillet again over medium-high heat. Cook the 
         pork chops in batches in the hot drippings until 
         evenly browned on both sides. Use additional bacon 
         drippings for each batch as needed. Remove the pork 
         chops to a cutting board and blot excess fat off the 
         surface of the chops with a paper towel; cut into 
         bite-sized cubes and stir into the bacon mixture.
