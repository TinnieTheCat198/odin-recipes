        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 slices bacon, diced</li>
            <li>2 large onions, diced</li>
            <li>¼ cup Hungarian paprika</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>5 pounds boneless pork chops, trimmed</li>
            <li>1 large yellow bell pepper, seeded and diced</li>
            <li>2 (14 ounce) cans diced tomatoes, with liquid</li>
            <li>⅔ cup beef broth</li>
            <li>2 cups reduced-fat sour cream</li>
            <li>2 (6 ounce) packages wide egg noodles</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook
         over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about
         10 minutes. Drain, and reserve the drippings. Add
         the onions to the bacon and cook together until the 
         onion is translucent. Remove skillet from heat and 
         stir the paprika, garlic powder, and pepper into the 
         bacon mixture. Transfer the mixture into a large 
         stockpot.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Heat a small amount of the reserved bacon drippings
         in the skillet again over medium-high heat. Cook the 
         pork chops in batches in the hot drippings until 
         evenly browned on both sides. Use additional bacon 
         drippings for each batch as needed. Remove the pork 
         chops to a cutting board and blot excess fat off the 
         surface of the chops with a paper towel; cut into 
         bite-sized cubes and stir into the bacon mixture.
        </p> 

        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Heat a small amount of the bacon drippings in the 
            skillet; cook and stir the bell pepper in the hot 
            drippings until softened and fragrant; drain on a plate
             lined with paper towels. Stir the cooked pepper into 
             the bacon mixture.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Pour the tomatoes with liquid and beef broth into a 
            stockpot and place the pot over medium-high heat. 
            Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to medium-low. 
            Cook until the stew begins to thicken, stirring 
            occasionally, about 90 minutes. Stir the sour cream 
            into the stew just before serving.
        </p>

        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Bring a pot with lightly-salted water and bring to a 
            rolling boil; add the egg noodles to the water and 
            return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, 
            until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm 
            to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander 
            set in the sink. Ladle the stew over the drained noodles 
            to serve.</p>
